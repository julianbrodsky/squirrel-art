#  🎨 Squirrel Art 🎨
This is a 3d display of the art I've been making with OpenAI's Dall-E 2.0!

# 💻 Tech Stack 💻
This site is powered by threejs, which is built on WebGL. The squirrel art is displayed as if it were the map of a skybox. The site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

# ✍️ Citation ✍️
Thanks to SimonDev on YouTube for walking through much of the skybox code! This was my first project using a skybox.
